### Classification and selection of text editors.
Text editors are software tools where we can type in a text. Some examples of **basic text editors** are such word processors as *MS Word* and *Apple Pages*. There are also **code-specific text editors** that web developers use to create internet sites or apps. For an example, a code written in those text editors transforms into a user friendly web page. There are many different text editors available for download, unless already included with your operating system. Examples are *NotePad++*, *Visual Studio Code*, *Atom*. Most are free, some you have to buy. But the main thing to consider when choosing a text editor is whether it has the right features that will help a developer when writing and editing a code.
### Most important features in a text editor:
* ***Code completion:***
  * Offers suggestions to finish typing code.
* ***Synthax highlighting and themes***
  * Text turns into various colors thus helping to differentiate sections of code; background themes help prevent eye fatigue. 
* ***Availability of extensions***
  * Similar to plug-ins that give you more functionality in a text editor.

If you take a step further, there is an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**, which in addition to being a text editor is also a debugger, a file manager, and a compiler.

### The Terminal
The terminal is a *text based interface*. Unlike a graphical user interface (GUI), it operates through typed text commands and text responses. 

### The Terminal basic commands

- *Up* and *Down* arrows - Scroll through command history
- `pwd` (Print Working Directory) - Shows current directory you are working in
- `ls` (list) - Lists items in a current directory (not including hidden files)
  - `ls -l` (long list option) - Lists items with details
  - `ls /etc` - List items in ***/etc*** directory
- `ls -a` - list including hidden files
- `cd` - change directory
- `~` - shortcut for a home directory
- `.` - reference to current directory
- `..` - reference to the parent directory
- `file [path]` - a type of file
-  `` `...` `` Anything inside quotes is recognized as a single item (e.g. to escape spaces in names)
-  `\ ` - Escape character
