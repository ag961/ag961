# Read 17: AWS: S3 and Lambda

1. Describe “The Cloud” - "The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines. [Ref][1]
2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)? - A container 'contains' both an application and all the elements the application needs to run properly, including system libraries, system settings, and other dependencies. Like a 'just add water' pancake mix, containers only need one thing – to be hosted and run – in order to perform their function. [Ref](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/)
3. What is auto-scaling? - AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. [Ref](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/)
4. What is bandwidth? - Bandwidth is measured as the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time. Typically, bandwidth is expressed as a bitrate and measured in bits per second (bps). [Ref](https://www.paessler.com/it-explained/bandwidth)
5. How do cloud providers compute service costs? - The key cost factors which decide cloud hosting prices are storage, networking and computing. [Ref](https://www.cloudoye.com/kb/generic/how-do-cloud-providers-decide-how-much-to-charge)

## Vocabulary

- Server Instances - in AWS, server instances are virtual machines or virtual environments. These virtual environments are isolated from the underlying base OS. It’s an On-demand service, i.e. a user can rent the virtual server(instances) on an hourly base and deploy their applications on it. [Ref](https://www.edureka.co/blog/ec2-instances-in-aws/)
- Containers - A container 'contains' both an application and all the elements the application needs to run properly, including system libraries, system settings, and other dependencies. Like a 'just add water' pancake mix, containers only need one thing – to be hosted and run – in order to perform their function. [Ref](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/serverless-vs-containers/)
- Cloud Services - The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. [Ref](https://www.citrix.com/ru-ru/solutions/digital-workspace/what-is-a-cloud-service.html)
- Cloud Architecture - Cloud architecture defines the technology components that are combined to build a cloud, where resources are pooled through virtualization technology and shared across a network. The components of a cloud architecture include: 
  - A front-end platform (the client or device used to access the cloud) 
  - One or more back-end platforms (servers and storage) 
  - A cloud-based delivery methodology 
  - A network to connect cloud clients, servers, and storage  [Ref](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/cloud-architecture)
- AWS - Amazon Web Services
- EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku
