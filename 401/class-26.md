# Read 26: Component Based UI

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
   - Vue
   - Angular (by Google)
   - Ember
   - Svelte 3
   - Ext JS by Sencha
2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
   When you use a library, you are in control. You can call for the library wherever you feel like. When you use a FWK though, it sets the basement. The Frwk clearly mentions where all codes are needed.
   In other words, you are in charge when you use a JavaScript library. When you use frameworks, the framework usually is. [Ref](https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/dev-hub/javascript/javascript-frameworks-guide/)


## Vocabulary

- Rendering - Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. [Ref](https://www.seobility.net/en/wiki/Rendering)
- Templates - React templates are sets of ready-to-use parts of code built using React technology for the development of dynamic user interfaces. [Ref](https://flatlogic.com/blog/what-is-react-template-react-template-definition/)
- State - a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent an information about the component’s current situation.
It’s managed in the component (just like any variable declared in a function). The difference is while a “normal” variable “disappears” when their function exits, the state variables are preserved by React. [Ref](https://medium.com/edonec/state-in-react-an-overview-a182675cee2c)
