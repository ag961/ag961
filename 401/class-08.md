# Access Control (ACL)

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?:

Basic authorization is used with username/password to get access to routes, etc. Bearer Authorization uses a generated JWT toke instead, to minimazie the transmission of username/password across parties for every request.

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. ([Source](https://jwt.io/introduction))
 
3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

Like other access token and keys, it should be saved as an environment variable for security, and not on our server code.

## Vocabulary

- encryption - Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext. ([source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/data-encryption-and-decryption))

- token - An authentication token securely transmits information about user identities between applications and websites. They enable organizations to strengthen their authentication processes for such services.
An authentication token allows internet users to access applications, services, websites, and application programming interfaces (APIs) without having to enter their login credentials each time they visit. Instead, the user logs in once, and a unique token is generated and shared with connected applications or websites to verify their identity.
These tokens are the digital version of a stamped ticket to an event. The user or bearer of the token is provided with an access token to a website until they log out or close the service. ([source](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/authentication-token))

- bearer - Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources ([source](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/))
- secret - a string that is only known to the server and used to create a JWT.
- JSON Web Token - SON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. ([source](https://jwt.io/))
