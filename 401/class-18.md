# Read 18: AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

1. What are serverless functions? - Single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies. The engineering teams within those companies ensure that the serverless functions have near-perfect uptime, redundant instances around the world, and scale to any incoming network request volume. (Ref)[https://www.pubnub.com/blog/what-is-a-serverless-function/]
   
2. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
   At this point, I am not sure of how I would do it. Would need to make a deeper research into how AWS built thier Lambda function, what resources they are using, then would do the same. 
   
3. Describe how a CDN works - A content delivery network, or content distribution network (CDN), is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users. (Ref)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network]

- Cloud Storage - a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data available and accessible, and the physical environment secured, protected, and running. People and organizations buy or lease storage capacity from the providers to store user, organization, or application data. (Ref)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage]
