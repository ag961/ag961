# Bearer Authorization

1. Write the following steps in the correct order ([source](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/flows/authorization-code-flow#how-it-works)):

    - Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret

    - Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party

    - Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

    - Receive authorization code

    - Make a request to the access token endpoint

    - Receive access token

    - Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

2. What can you do with an authorization code?

    - Exchange it for access token
 
3. What can you do with an access token?

    - Use it to access routes that require authentication/authorization

4. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

    - It allows delegated authorization to third-party apps on behalf of a user, without actually giving that app the username/password combination. ([source](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth))

## Vocabulary
