# Read 27: useState() Hook

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
 React is a framework that creates single page apps. Vanilla JS/HTML/CSS creates multiple pages. 
2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
Function component is just a javascript function that accepts props as arguments and can use hooks to mange state.
Class component is a subclass that needs to extend React.Component.


## Vocabulary

- Functional Components - JavaScript functions that are valid React components because they accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and return a React element. [Ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)

- Children / Child Components - Components that are imported and rendered by another component (parent).
