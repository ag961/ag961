Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:


| SQL         | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| relational database      |  non-relational database      |
| predefined schema |  dynamic schema |
|  uses tables  |   uses collections of documents      | 	 
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
| excellent support from vendors |  limited expert support |

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    - Complex queries
Give a real world example.
    - tables which consists of n number of rows of data
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    - Large data
Give a real world example.
    - graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases.
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    - NoSQL
Which type of database is best for scalability?
    - NoSQL, as it is easier to add servers, than keep increasing RAM and CPU for SQL.

What does SQL stand for?
    - structured query language
What is a relational database?
    - it is a database that works with certain assumptions, in a certain way. SQL databases consist of tables that are related to each other.
What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    - tables
What is a ‘schema’?
    - a fixed format or structure of fields(rows) that every record has to adhere to
What is a NoSQL database?
    - Nonstructured query language database, built to store lots of data in an efficient way. 
How does it work?
    - It uses collections instead of tables in SQL. Data dos not have to follow the schema.
What is inside of a Mongo database?
    - collections and documents
Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
    - MongoDb is more flexible, because it doesn't follow schema, no relations, more data can be added with extra stuff.
What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - having duplicate data, that both have to be updated in case one changes.
