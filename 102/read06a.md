# Dynamic Web-pages with JavaScript

### HTML, CSS and JavaScript

JavaScript is a separate layer that builds on HTML and CSS. Using JS, we can change how the pages behaves, adding interactivity.  

It's best to keep JS code in its own file with ".js" extension.

`<script>` element is used in HTML to link the browser to JS file.

### Basic Javascript Instructions

A script is a series of instructions (known as ***statements***), that a computer can follow one-by-one.

Comments explain what your code does Multi-line comments are between `/*` and `*/` caracters. Single-line comments follow two slashes `//`

***Variables*** is where a script temporarily stores information.

#### Steps:

1. **Declare the variable** - create and give it a name

2. **Assign a value to the variable** - what information to store

#### Rules to follow in giving variable a name:

1. The name can only begin with a letter, "$", or "_".
2. Nmame can contain letters, numbers, "$". or "_". No "-" or ".".
3. No keywords or reserved words.
4. Variables are cas sensitive.
5. Nmae should describe what variable stores.
6. More that 1 word - second word starts with Uppercase or "_"
