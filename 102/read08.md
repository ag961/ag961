# Operators and Loops

### Comparison Operators

* `==` - equal to
* `===` strict equal to (both data type and value are the same)
* `!=` - is not equal to
* `!=` - strict not equal to
* `>` - greater than
* `>=` - greater than or equal to
* `<` - less than
* `<=` - less than or equal to

### Logical Operators

* `&&` - Logical AND. If both expressions are true, then true. Otherwise returns false
* `||` - Logical OR. If either is true, then returns true. If both false, returns false.
* `!` - Logical NOT. Takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.

### Loops

**For** loop. Runs a code a specific number of times.  

`for (var i = 0; i < value; i++) { code to execute during loop}

Where `var i = 0;` is initialization. `i<10;` is condition. `i++` is update

**While** loop.  Condition can be other than the counter, and the code will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.
