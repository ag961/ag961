### Classification and selection of text editors.
Text editors are software tools that web developers use to create internet sites. A code written in those text editors transforms into user friendly web pages. There are many different text editors available for download, unless already included with your operating system. Most are free, some you have to buy. But the main thing to consider when choosing a text editor is whether it has the right features that will help a developer when writing and editing the code.
### Most important features in a text editor:
* ***Code completion:*** 
  * Offers suggestions to finish typing code.
* ***Synthax highlighting*** and ***themes***
  * Text turns into various colors thus helping to differentiate sections of code; background themes help prevent eye fatigue. 
* Availability of ***extensions***
  * Similar to plug-ins that give you more functionality in a text editor.
