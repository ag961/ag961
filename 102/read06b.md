# How computers work

To be able to work, a computer has to perform this 4 tasks:

1. ***Input*** - take input
2. ***Storage*** - store information
3. ***Process*** the information
4. ***Output*** the results

Computers use a binary system to represent numbers, text, images/videos and sound. The information travels as an electric signal through tiny wires that form into circuits. The computer receives a binary input. The CPU then asks the instructions from a memory on how to process it. Then after processing, the CPU sends the information as a new binary code into memory for storage. From there the infromation travels out to an output device.
The operating system of a computer control the flow of information between the software that we use and the CPU.
