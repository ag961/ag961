# Programming with JavaScript

### The ABC of programmimg

JavaScript is a language that gives developers lots of abilities to program their web-sites to interact with users. It can access contents of a page, modify it, and react to scpecific events happening on the page.  

JavaScript does so through **scripts**, which are instructions that a computer can follow. A computer is very obedient, and will do exactly what we tell it to do. But instructions have to be very specific, step-by-step. And unlike humans, computers don't learn, so they have to be told what to do everytime they run a script.

Scripts have to be carefully designed. A big first step is creating a ***flowchart***, which is a diagram that resembles a protocol. It gives everyone a picture of how things should run ste-by-step.

### Expressions + Operators

***Expressions*** evaluate into a single value. They could either assign a value to a variable, or use two or more values to return a single value.

***Operators***: those are `=`, `*`, `+`, `>`, `&&`.

Artihmetic operators are: `+, -, /, *, ++, __, and %`. Besides number, they can also use variables that respresent numbers.

String operator: `+` symbol. It joins the strings and puts them side by side, crating a new variable.

### Functions

They let you group a series of statements to perform a specific task. When you ask the function to perform its task, it is known as ***calling*** the function. The response of a function is known as a return value.
