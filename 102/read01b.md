# Growth mindset (example of a first-tier heading with `#`)

Growth mindset is a mental state fueled by aspiration to achieve something *bigger* (example of italics using single stars) and ability to overcome challenges that lay ahead through persistence. The unstoppable willingness to grow has to come from the inside. Once it appears, you have to act on it. Decisions don't come easy. But after I set my sights on something, the race is on. It doesn't matter whether we have a talent for it.  
As someone said before: (example of a quote using `>` in front of the text )
> Success is 1% talent, and 99% hard work.

There are certain thoughts that keep me going when I start hitting road blocks.

### Growth mindset reminders (example of a #3 heading with `###`)

- **reminder 1:** (example of a bold text and unordered list)
  - If it's not raining, you ain't training. (example of subpoint with two spaces and `-` before text)
- **reminder 2:**
  - If someone can do it, I can do it
- **reminder 3:**
  - Build the schedule and stick to it. There is time to work, there is time to rest. All in its own time.
