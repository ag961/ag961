The article talks about the research that was conducted by Goggle's Project Aristotle to find out what made some teams to be successful, while others fail.

They couldn't find common patterns in succesful teams at first. As they dug deeper, they came to several comclusion:


- Individual smartness of each of the members did not matter.

- *Group norms* was responisble for teams efficiency. Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

- On the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion.

- If only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.

- Memebrs of good teams were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

Article mentions **psychological safety** — shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up (Edmondson, 1999).

Researchers conclude, that to be effective, teams have to establish psychological safety through communication, conversational turn-taking, and empathy.
