# CSS Layout

Source:
> Duckett, J. (2011). *HTML & CSS: Design and build websites.* Indianapolis, IN: Wiley

Every HTML element is a box, either a block level or an inline box.

**Containing (parent) element** - a block-level element that houses another block level element (**child**). 

*Position* property:

* static

* relative (in relation to where it would have been in normal flow).

* absolute - doesn't affect position of other elements.

* fixed - in relation to browser window.

*Z-index* - controls which element sits on top if there is an overlap. Higher number sits on top.

*Float* - elements become block-level, around which other content can flow (to right or left of it). Also used to place elements side by side.

### Layouts

* Fixed width - do not change size when browser window size changed.

* Liquid - stretch and contract in realtion to browser window size.

* Grids - help structure the page.  

### CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks aim to make our life easier by providing the code for common tasks.

One of the most popular uses of CSS is in creating grids to layout pages. One of the popular ones is 960 Grid System.

Using 960.gs we can provide appropriate classes to our code and it will create multiple column layouts for us.
