It is preferred to control height and width of images in CSS rather than HTML.

`float` proerty is increasingly used to align images, allowing text to flow to the right or left of it.

To center an image, it should be turned into a block element. Then: 

1. `text-align: center` on the containing element. Or,

2. `margin` proerty on the image itself and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

### Background images

* `background-image` places an image behind any HTML element.

* `background-repeat`:

  * `repeat` - img repepeated horizontally and vertically;
  
  * `repeat-x` - horizontally only

  * `repeat-y` - vertically only
  
  * `no-repeat` - showb once

* `background-attachment`
  
  * `fixed` - stays in same position as we scroll
  
  * `scroll` - moves up and down on scroll

* `background-position` - where in the browser window shoul be placed. Has a pair values.

* `background` - shorthand
