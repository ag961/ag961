### Welcome to my first page!
My name is Ayrat. Please visit my [GitHub portfolio page!](https://github.com/ag961).


I am from Kazan, a capital of Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. Famous for its white-walled Kremlin and a thousand years history, the city showcases an example of peaceful cohabitation of two culturally different ethinicities, Tatars and Russians. Second only to Saint-Petersburg and Moscow by popularity, it is one of the hidden gems for tourists to visit while in Russia. ![Kazan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81946031/114297021-2cdc3180-9a63-11eb-99e6-25aa3be144bb.png)
