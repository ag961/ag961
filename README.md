### Welcome to my first page!
My name is Ayrat. Please visit my [GitHub portfolio page!](https://github.com/ag961)
I am from Kazan, a capital of Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. Famous for its white-walled Kremlin and a thousand years history, the city boasts an example of peaceful cohabitation of two culturally different ethinicities, Tatars and Russians. ![Kazan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81946031/114297021-2cdc3180-9a63-11eb-99e6-25aa3be144bb.png) 
Second only to Saint-Petersburg and Moscow by popularity, it is one of the hidden gems for tourists to visit while in Russia.

# Growth mindset
Growth mindset is a mental state fueled by aspiration to achieve something *bigger* and ability to overcome challenges that lay ahead through persistence. The unstoppable willingness to grow has to come from the inside. Once it appears, you have to act on it. Decisions don't come easy. But after I set my sights on something, the race is on. It doesn't matter whether we have a talent for it. 
As someone said before:
> Success is 1% talent, and 99% hard work.

There certain thoughts that keep me going when I start hitting road blocks. Let's call them reminders.
### Growth mindset reminders
- **reminder 1:** 
  - If it's not raining, you ain't training.
- **reminder 2:**
  - If someone can do it, I can do it
- **reminder 3:**
  - Build the schedule and stick to it. There is time to work, there is time to rest. All in its own time.
