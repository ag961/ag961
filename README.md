# Growth mindset
Growth mindset is a mental state fueled by aspiration to achieve something *bigger* and ability to overcome challenges that lay ahead through persistence. The unstoppable willingness to grow has to come from the inside. Once it appears, you have to act on it. Decisions don't come easy. But after I set my sights on something, the race is on. It doesn't matter whether we have a talent for it. 
As someone said before:
> Success is 1% talent, and 99% hard work.

There certain thoughts that keep me going when I start hitting road blocks. Let's call them reminders.
### Growth mindset reminders
- **reminder 1:** 
  - If it's not raining, you ain't training.
- **reminder 2:**
  - If someone can do it, I can do it
- **reminder 3:**
  - Build the schedule and stick to it. There is time to work, there is time to rest. All in its own time.
